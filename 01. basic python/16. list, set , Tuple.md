# List in python

![[Screenshot 2025-12-01 at 2.39.48 PM.png]]

```python
fuits = ["apple","orange","banana","coconut"]
#range is play
print(fuits[0:2])
```
```
['apple', 'orange']
```


reverce
```PYTHON
fuits = ["apple","orange","banana","coconut"]

print(fuits[::-1])
```
```
['coconut', 'banana', 'orange', 'apple']
```

check item is there or not
```python
print("apple" in fuits)
```


check the length of the list
```python
print(len(fuits))
```


add new item to list
```python
fuits.append("others")
```

insert
```python
list.insert(index, element)

my_list = [1, 2, 4, 5]
my_list.insert(2, 3)  # Insert 3 at index 2
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

```


remove existing item
```python
fuits.remove("others")
```

ascending order
```python
mylist = ["asdasdas","kjhu","bdasd","oasdadsa"]

mylist.sort()

print(mylist)
```

```python
mylist = ["asdasdas","kjhu","bdasd","oasdadsa"]
mylist.reverse()
print(mylist)
```

```python
mylist = ["asdasdas","kjhu","bdasd","oasdadsa"]
mylist.sort()
mylist.reverse()
print(mylist)
```

```python
fuits = ["apple","orange","banana","coconut"]
fuits.clear()
print(fuits)
```

```python
fuits = ["apple","orange","banana","coconut"]
print(fuits.index("apple"))
```

```python
fuits = ["apple","orange","banana","coconut","apple","apple"]
print(fuits.count("apple"))
```



#  Set in python

**set vs list**

**Order**: Lists are ordered collections, meaning elements maintain the order you add them and can be accessed by index. Sets are unordered, so elements have no fixed position and cannot be accessed by index.

**Duplicates**: Lists allow duplicate elements, while sets automatically remove duplicates and only store unique values.
Mutability: Both lists and sets are mutable, allowing you to add or remove elements. However, elements in a set must be immutable types.

**Usage**: Lists are ideal when order matters or when you want to store duplicate items. Sets are useful for membership testing, removing duplicates, and performing mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

**Performance**: Sets provide faster membership tests due to their underlying hash implementation, making them more efficient for checking if an element exists compared to lists.
